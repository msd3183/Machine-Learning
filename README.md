Water Quality Classification

For the purpose of regulating water quality and safeguarding public health and the environment, 
monitoring water quality is crucial. Significant prospects exist for artificial intelligence (AI) to 
help with classification and water quality prediction (WQ). This study evaluates different AI 
algorithms to manage WQ data gathered over a long period of time and provide a reliable method 
for forecasting water quality as precisely as feasible. The WQ data was classified using the Water 
Quality Index by a number of machine learning classifiers and their stacking ensemble models 
(WQI). Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision 
Tree (DT), CATBoost, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron were among the classifiers that were 
examined (MLP). 1679 samples and associated meta-data were collected over a nine-year period 
and were part of the dataset used in the study. 
Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) and precision-recall curves were 
utilised to evaluate the effectiveness of the different classifiers. The results showed that, with a 
percentage of 94.51, the CATBoost model was the most accurate classifier.As a primary gradient 
boosting algorithm and meta classifier, the CATBoost also had the highest accuracy. The boosting 
algorithm is therefore suggested as a solid method for the WQ classification.
